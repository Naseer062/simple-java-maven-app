What is an application migration strategy?
Application migration strategy generally refers to the process of migrating the whole application environment and its computing infrastructure. This is usually driven by business decisions for cost optimization, finding more agility, or simply because of the update of old systems. Here are some basic examples of general application migration:
Migrate an application from one on-premises data center to another
From a public cloud to a private cloud environment or vice versa
From an on-premises server to a public cloud environment
Migrating an application from one cloud provider to another
